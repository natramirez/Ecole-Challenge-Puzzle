Description:
Each list form component, which I called a "dynamic list" or dynList for short, has its own submit button. The code can be easily modified to have a single submit button, so that there are mutliple lists per one submit button, depending on the ultimate functionality of the dynamic list object.
I have coded the javascript file to require a dynlist.php file to have the lists "sent" to, though this file is mostly a dummy file that helps with debugging.
